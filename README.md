# Rationale
Menstrual pain, heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), irregular periods (metrorrhagia), painful periods (dysmenorrhea) and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are thought to affect a high proportion of
menstruating women, and there is some evidence that these symptoms are associated with poor health, quality of life and productivity at school and work.

It is unclear to what extent these symptoms co-exist and whether different symptoms are associated with different exposures and health outcomes.

A better understanding of factors associated with women's experience of menstruation will inform ways to predict which women are at risk of poor outcomes and help 
develop supportive strategies. It could have important policy implications for tailored provision of menstrual health care and subsidised hygiene products, as well
as better support of menstruating women in educational institutions, work and public areas.

# Aims & Objectives
This project uses basic epidemiological methods to explore the prevalence of menstrual symptoms in ALSPAC and to explore correlation between different symptoms.

It also uses a novel, hypothesis-generating EWAS approach to identify exposures and health outcomes that might be causally associated with menstrual symptoms.

# Methods
1)  Extract questionnaire data on menstrual symptoms from ALSPAC G0 and G1 and derive variables
2)  Calculate the proportion of women experiencing different menstrual symptoms, within and across timepoints
3)  Calculate correlation matrices of menstrual symptoms
4)  Conduct epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of each menstrual symptom with minimal adjustment for potential confounders (due to hypothesis-free aspect)
5)  Describe the top CpGs from each EWAS and explore overlap and correlation between symptoms
6)  Conduct a lookup of CpGs associated with each symptom in the EWAS catalog to identify exposures and health outcomes that might be associated with menstrual
    symptoms (i.e. potential confounders of the association between methylation and menstrual symptoms)
7)  Confirm in ALSPAC whether the factors identified in step 6 are indeed associated with menstrual symptoms
